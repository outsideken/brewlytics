brewlytics is a browser-based data analytics platform that allows analysts to solve and automate their organizationâ€™s most challenging data problems. Without writing a line of code, brewlytics functional blocks empower analysts to intuitively capture their data processing workflows and expose their results through custom Web-based dashboards to decision makers. 

Using Python in brewlytics allows users to leverage the power of Python and its libraries to bring new functionality to their workflows.

This brewlytics Github repository contains Python script examples intended for use with brewlytics `Define Python Script` functional and demonstrate different analytic tasks and capabilities using Python in brewlytics. 

The use of Github with brewlytics allows users to do the following:

* Version control and tracking for code changes
* Aid in discovery of Python-based solutions already implemented in brewlytics without having to dig through models

This repository is a work in progress.
